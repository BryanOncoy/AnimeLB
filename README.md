This project was designed and developed by me and a classmate as our final project. It was developed for academic purposes only.

I was mainly focused on the logic side of the project, as well as on the design of the application.

The project is built in Android Studio, with the code written in Java.
It allows the user to register and log in with his own email or a google account. This was achieved by using Firebase FireAuthentication.
The user has the freedom to explore through a wide variety of series, save them to check them later and watch its episodes. Web scraping technique was required to get all this series information.
In order to save the users' favourite series, Firestore was our choice as the database for the project.
The app also allows the user to change its password, follow his friends and check their favourite animes.
Every user has the option of changing his profile picture by taking a photo with the camera or by uploading one. This picture is saved in Firebase Storage.

I leave the following items to check:
- A short demo of the app working.
- An apk to install the app.
- The Android Studio project of the app.
